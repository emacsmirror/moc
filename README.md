## Extending

This package was developed alongside Macro Slides.  Macro Slides is focused on
the structure of presentation sequences and using Org documents to declare the
structure.

Master of Ceremonies should be useful for any presentation package, not just
Macro Slides.

## Planned Features

- Displaying notes in a separate buffer, a complement to hiding elements for
  presentation.
  
- Settings profiles for quickly changing many settings at once.
