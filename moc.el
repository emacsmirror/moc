;; - fullscreen focus with highlight and playback with `moc-focus'
;; - set an exact frame resolution for capture with `moc-fixed-frame-set'
;; - subtle, disappearing cursor with `moc-subtle-cursor-mode'
;; - hide cursor entirely with `moc-hide-cursor-mode'
;; - supress all messages with `moc-quiet-mode'
;; - remap many faces with `moc-face-remap'
;; - set many options at once with `moc-dispatch'
;;
