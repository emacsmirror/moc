** Status üë∑
This package is still pre-1.0.  Read the NEWS.org and release notes

The ~mc-focus~ command and others are super useful and is used in almost every video or presentation I make!  Therefore, it is made available in this early state.

Subscribe to [[https://www.youtube.com/@Positron-gv7do][Positron's YouTube channel]] to catch updates on when it's added to package archives and more information about how to use it.
